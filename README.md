## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to bring the convenience of contactless payments, widely popular in fiat transactions, to the cryptocurrency space. We have developed a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer payment service that uses the ISO14443 NFC standard to facilitate secure cryptocurrency transfers.

### Problem Statement

Our solution addresses several key limitations in existing crypto transaction methods, specifically with QR codes:
- **Security Risks**: QR codes can be scanned by nearby individuals, making them susceptible to interception.
- **Environmental Dependence**: QR codes require adequate lighting and may be unreliable in low-light conditions.

With NFC, transactions are performed within a 5 cm range, making it almost impossible to intercept or relay. This short-range technology is already trusted in modern banking, and we’re leveraging it to expand the Web3 ecosystem.

### Solution

Our system uses the ISO14443 NFC standard to enable secure, contactless data exchange between payer and payee without reliance on centralized intermediaries. This design provides a reliable, decentralized alternative to traditional QR code and smart card-based solutions.

## Key Features and Benefits

1. **Enhanced Security**: NFC’s short-range operation provides a more secure transaction method than QR codes.
2. **Decentralization**: Unlike NFC-enabled smart cards that require centralized services for transaction validation, our solution is fully decentralized, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
3. **Ease of Access**: Our approach requires only two NFC-enabled smartphones, eliminating the need for custom hardware. Custom PoS hardware can be added but is optional.

## Competitive Landscape

### Competitors

- **QR Codes**: Our solution offers a security and usability advantage over QR codes, which are easily compromised and lighting-dependent.
- **NFC-Enabled Smart Cards**: While existing NFC-enabled smart cards for crypto transactions typically require centralized validation, our solution is unique in providing true decentralization.

## Integration with Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)

We are deploying our service on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)** network, acting as a fully decentralized point-of-sale (PoS) terminal. By integrating with ICP, we create a robust, decentralized transaction service, enhancing security and reliability.

### ICP Unique Features Utilized

- **Decentralized PoS Terminal**: Our system leverages ICP to eliminate centralized points of failure, creating a reliable, decentralized solution.
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: With the ICP integration, users gain flexibility and security for on-chain transactions via NFC technology.
